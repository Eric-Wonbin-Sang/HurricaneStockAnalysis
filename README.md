# HurricaneStockAnalysis
This was a project for my Financial Econometrics course where we had to create our own trading strategy. The idea of this strategy was to see if there was a correlation between the distances between hurricane paths and headquarters of energy companies. This project has not been worked on recently, but I am planning on doing a major revamp.
